This directory contains example code for the book "Common Lisp
Recipes" by Edmund Weitz.  These are just code fragments intended to
save you some typing if you want to follow the book's text.

Most files consist only of ASCII characters.  The few exceptions are
UTF-8 encoded and should open up in Emacs without problems.

There's a main file "code.lisp" for each chapter.  Some directories
also include additional Lisp code files and maybe also HTML files or
C, C++, or Java code.
