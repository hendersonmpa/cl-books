;;; disambig.lsp [Chapter  8] PATR grammar showing disambiguation by semantic features

;;; This grammar illustrates the use of semantic markers to
;;; reduce the number of parses
;;; E.g. it only produces one analysis of each of the following
;;;     get a screwdriver with a narrow blade
;;;     get a screwdriver with your left hand
