Open source examples for my book "Loving Common Lisp, or the Savvy Programmer's Secret Weapon"

July 5, 2013: I am working on the third edition of this book, discarding a few of the old examples and adding several new ones.

I hope to have a "beta" copy of the book released by the end of July 2013.

Note: most of the small examples are in the **src** directory while larger examples in book are in their own top level directories.
